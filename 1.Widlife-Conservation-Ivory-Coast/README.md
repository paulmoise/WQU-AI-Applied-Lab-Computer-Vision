# 🐾 Wildlife Image Classification Project 

##  Project Overview  
In this project, you'll dive into a **data science competition** aimed at helping scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve.  The goal is to analyze images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. 🐾 By participating in this competition, you'll expand your **machine learning skills** by building advanced neural network models capable of processing images and classifying them into multiple categories. 

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- **How to read image files and preprocess them for machine learning**  
-  **How to use PyTorch to manipulate tensors and build neural network models**  
- **How to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for image data**  
- **How to use your trained model to make predictions on new images**  
- **How to format and submit your predictions for the competition**  

This project is a fantastic opportunity to sharpen your **deep learning skills** while contributing to wildlife conservation efforts! 🌍🐘
