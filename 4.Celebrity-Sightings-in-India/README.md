# Face Detection and Recognition with Mary Kom  

## Project Overview  
In this project, you'll learn how to perform **face detection and recognition** tasks using a video of an interview with Indian Olympic boxer **Mary Kom**. You'll leverage a state-of-the-art pre-trained **Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN)** model combined with the **Inception-ResNet** model to achieve accurate face recognition.  

The goal is to extract selected video frames of Mary Kom and her interviewer, create **face embeddings** for each of them, and use these embeddings to detect their faces in new images. Finally, you'll wrap your code into a **Flask app** that allows users to upload an image and perform face recognition.  

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- **How to use pre-trained MTCNN and Inception-ResNet V1 models from `facenet_pytorch`**  
- **How to obtain face bounding boxes and cropped faces using MTCNN**  
- **How to create face embeddings using Inception-ResNet**  
- **How to construct a library of known face embeddings**  
- **How to determine if an image contains a face from the library of known faces**  
- **How to build and deploy a Flask app for face recognition**  

This project is a fantastic opportunity to explore **advanced computer vision techniques** and build a practical application for face recognition!
