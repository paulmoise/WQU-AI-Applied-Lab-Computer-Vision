# Medical Image Generation with GANs  

## Project Overview  
In this project, you'll explore **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic **medical images** like X-rays and MRIs. You'll build a **custom GAN** from scratch and also use a **pre-trained GAN** to create realistic images.  

To make it interactive, you'll develop a **Streamlit web app** that allows users to generate medical images dynamically. You'll also use **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration.  

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- **How to build and train a GAN from scratch**  
- **How to generate images using a pre-trained GAN**  
- **How to train models with synthetic medical data**  
- **How to build a web app using Streamlit**  
- **How to track and share code with Git & GitHub**

This project is a great way to explore **AI in healthcare** and build hands-on experience with GANs!
