# WorldQuant University - Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

I completed the **WorldQuant University's Applied AI Lab** on **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** and earned my certification! This repository showcases the projects I worked on and the skills I gained during the program.

## About the Program

The Applied AI Lab is a free, online program by WorldQuant University that focuses on teaching practical AI skills. It covers how to use deep learning to help computers "see" and understand images, just like humans do.

The program includes **six hands-on projects** that explore real-world applications of computer vision, such as:

- **Image Classification**: Teaching computers to identify objects in pictures, like telling a cat from a dog.
- **Object Detection**: Finding and labeling multiple objects in an image, like a self-driving car spotting pedestrians and traffic lights.
- **Generative AI**: Creating new images using AI, similar to deepfakes or AI-generated art.

## 1. Wildlife Image Classification Project

**Overview:**
Analyze camera trap images to classify which animal is present, supporting wildlife conservation. This project involves building advanced neural network models for image classification.

**Skills Learned:**
- Reading and preprocessing image files
- Using PyTorch for tensor manipulation and neural network modeling
- Designing and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Making predictions and submitting results for a data science competition

## 2. Crop Disease Classification in Uganda

**Overview:**
Work with crop disease images from Uganda to build a CNN that classifies images into five categories. The project emphasizes transfer learning and training optimization.

**Skills Learned:**
- Dataset exploration and analysis
- Building and training CNNs for multi-class classification
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Overfitting mitigation and k-fold cross-validation
- Using callbacks (learning rate scheduling, checkpointing, early stopping)

## 3. Real-Time Traffic Object Detection in Dhaka, Bangladesh

**Overview:**
Process traffic video feeds to detect and label objects (cars, people, etc.) in real time. Extend pre-trained YOLO models to detect custom objects for traffic analysis.

**Skills Learned:**
- Working with XML bounding box data
- Extracting frames from video
- Applying and training YOLO for object detection
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
