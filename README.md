# WorldQuant University - Applied AI Lab: Deep Learning for Computer Vision 🤖📸

I completed the **WorldQuant University's Applied AI Lab** on **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** and earned my certification! This repository showcases the projects I worked on and the skills I gained during the program.

## About the Program

The Applied AI Lab is a free, online program by WorldQuant University that focuses on teaching practical AI skills. It covers how to use deep learning to help computers "see" and understand images, just like humans do.

The program includes **six hands-on projects** that explore real-world applications of computer vision, such as:

- **Image Classification**: Teaching computers to identify objects in pictures, like telling a cat from a dog. 🐶🐱
- **Object Detection**: Finding and labeling multiple objects in an image, like a self-driving car spotting pedestrians and traffic lights. 🚗🚦
- **Generative AI**: Creating new images using AI, similar to deepfakes or AI-generated art.

## Projects I Completed

Here are the projects I worked on:

- [**Wildlife Image Classification 🦁🌏**](./1.Widlife-Conservation-Ivory-Coast/): Classifying wildlife images to support conservation efforts.
- [**Crop Disease Monitoring 🌿**](./2.Crop-Disease-Uganda/): Detecting crop diseases to help farmers protect their crops.
- [**Traffic Flow Analysis 🚗**](./3.Traffic-monitoring-in-bangladesh/): Analyzing traffic patterns to reduce congestion in cities.
- [**Face Detection & Recognition 😊**](./4.Celebrity-Sightings-in-India/): Exploring how facial recognition works and its uses.
- [**Medical Image Generation 🏥**](./5.Medical-Data-in-Spain/): Using AI to create medical images for research and diagnostics.
- [**Meme Generator App 😂**](./6.Social-Media-Marketing-at-WQU/): Building a fun app to create memes using AI.

## Skills I Learned

During the program, I developed these skills:

- **Neural Networks**: Understanding how these AI models work.
- **PyTorch & Transformers**: Using popular tools to build and train AI models.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing data for machine learning.
- **Model Training**: Building and testing computer vision models.
- **Model Deployment**: Making AI models ready for real-world use.
- **Ethics in AI**: Understanding bias and ethical concerns in computer vision.

This program was an amazing learning experience, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects!
