# AI-Powered Meme Generation with Stable Diffusion  

## Project Overview  

This project explores **Stable Diffusion**, a powerful text-to-image generation model, to create **meme-worthy images** for social media marketing at WorldQuant University. You'll assemble a **Stable Diffusion pipeline**, fine-tune the model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, and deploy an interactive **Streamlit web app** that allows non-technical users to generate images easily.  

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- **How Stable Diffusion works and how to fine-tune it**  
- **How to generate images from text descriptions**  
- **How to use LoRA to personalize Stable Diffusion models**  
- **How to build an interactive web app with Streamlit**  
- **How to deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud for easy access**  

This project is an exciting fusion of **AI, creativity, and user-friendly app deployment**, making AI-generated content accessible to marketing teams!
