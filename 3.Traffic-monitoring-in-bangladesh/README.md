# Real-Time Traffic Object Detection in Dhaka, Bangladesh  

## Project Overview  
In this project, you'll work with **traffic video feed data** from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Your goal is to process each frame of the video to **detect and label objects** such as cars, people, and other traffic elements in **real-time**. You'll use a **pre-trained model** and extend it to detect **custom objects** tailored to the task of analyzing traffic feed data.  

Through this project, you'll learn:  

- **How to work with XML files containing bounding box data**  
- **How to extract frames from video files**  
- **How to apply the pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model**  
- **How to train YOLO to detect custom objects specific to traffic analysis**  
- **How to use data augmentation techniques to improve the model's ability to generalize during training**  

This project is an exciting opportunity to dive into **real-time object detection** and apply cutting-edge computer vision techniques to solve real-world traffic monitoring challenges!
