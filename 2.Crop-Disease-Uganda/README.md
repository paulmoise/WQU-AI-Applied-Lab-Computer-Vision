# Crop Disease Classification in Uganda  

## Project Overview  
In this project, you'll work with a dataset of **crop disease images** from Uganda. Your goal is to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into **five categories**. Along the way, you'll learn how to improve the performance of your computer vision model by leveraging **pre-trained models** and optimizing training with advanced techniques like **Callbacks**.  

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:  

- **Explore and analyze a crop disease image dataset**  
- **Build and train a CNN to classify images into five disease categories**  
- **Enhance your model using Transfer Learning with a pre-trained image classification model**  
- **Identify and address model overfitting**  
- **Evaluate model performance using k-fold cross-validation**  
- **Utilize Callbacks like Learning Rate Scheduling, Checkpointing, and Early Stopping to optimize training**  

This project is a great opportunity to apply **deep learning techniques** to a real-world problem, helping farmers in Uganda detect and manage crop diseases effectively!
